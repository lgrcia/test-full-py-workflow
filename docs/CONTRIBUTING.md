## Coding style
For core developments, here are some style guidelines we try to stick to:
- [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) formatting with a 88 characters line limit
- explicit variable name is preferred over comments
- extensive comments
- [numpy style](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#documenting-classes) docstrings
- tests with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/)

No matter your level of familiarity with any of these guidelines, we can all help to make your code compliant, so feel free to propose non-formatted code.
